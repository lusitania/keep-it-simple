keep-it-simple
==============

Simple solutions for common problems re-written in scripting languages.

Don't download any dubious binaries from the internet, use your favourite script interpreter to do the trick.

If the pip requirements (`.pip`) require provisioning themselves, like with 
ZeroMQ, you should have a look at the corresponding `.sh` file.
