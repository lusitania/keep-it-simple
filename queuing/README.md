# Motivation

Code under this category is meant to demonstrate unreliable data transfer like signalling or unsolicited messaging. I don't intend so solve particular problems here rather than to present isolated features or aspects.

.pip files are Python pip requirements. Use them like this:

```
pip3   -r zmq-simplex.pip
python -m zmq-simplex
```

If the Python requirements require provisioning themselves, like with ZeroMQ,
you should have a look at the .sh file.
