# Motivation
In a situation of rapidly changing folder contents it can become very
difficult to synchronise the contents to a backup location (ie. for migration
purposes) with system tools such as *rsync*. I've been in this situation in
2011 were *rsync* failed me because:

 - Building *rsync*'s job list took almost a week (no transfer done just yet)
 - After said week about 10% of the pool had already changed and as such was out of date
 - *tar*ing the folder with several million files inside took almost as long as *rsync*ing would have
 - source and backup contents shouldn't be more than a few hours "apart"

So instead of using a *block* procedure I devised an *online* replication
scheme to transfer files as they change and lazily work on the backlog of yet
unchanged/unsynced files. The original solution is closed source yet simple
enough to replicate in Python using ZeroMQ and python-inotify.

osync essentially integrates to other *simpletons*, namely filesystem-watcher
and queuing. Have a peek if you want to learn more about INotify and ZeroMQ.

# Instructions
TBD

# Discussion
TBD

 - It delivers whole messages exactly as they were sent
 - ZeroMQ guarantees to deliver all the parts (one or more) for a message, or none of them.
 - prevent slow joiner syndrome, where the subscriber loses messages as it connects to the server's socket
 - A message (single or multipart) must fit in memory.
 - high water mark

# Roadmap
 1. One-on-one synchronisation
 1. One-to-many synchronisation and service discovery
 1. Secure channel in application

# Design
Since this is about keeping it simple (and avoiding spaghetti code like in my old 2011-approach) I need to do some upfront design to give the code a more intuitive feel. The UML can be visualised with [PlanUML Online Server](http://www.plantuml.com/plantuml/form), later there will be pictures.

## Overview
The application passes trough three stages: Initialisation, Transfer and Termination.

```
@startuml
start
:Init Phase;
:Transfer Phase;
note right
  long running activity,
  process requires signal to proceed
end note
:Termination Phase;
stop
@enduml
```

Flow of events:

 1. In an *Initialisation Phase* two Endpoints connect and prepare for data transfer
 1. In a *Transfer Phase* the Source Endpoint sends the files notifies from the FileEvents to the Sink Endpoint
 1. In a *Termination Phase* an Endpoint send termination request which closes down the connection in mutual agreement

## Initialisation Phase
```
@startuml
left to right direction
SourceOp  <<Operator>>
SinkOp    <<Operator>>

rectangle "Init Phase" {
    :Init CommandChannel: as (ICC)
    :Init DataChannel: as (IDC)
    
    SourceOp ..> SinkOp : exchange ConnectionDetails
    
    SourceOp - (ICC) : <<initiate>>
    (ICC) - SinkOp : <<participate>>

    SinkOp -l- (IDC)
}
@enduml
```

## Case: Init CommandChannel
Participating actors: SourceOperator (SourceOp), SinkOperator (SinkOp)

Flow of events:

 1. The SourceOp starts the SourceControlService of SourceEndpoint with defined ConnetionDetails
    1. The SourceEndpoint binds a socket to the committed ConnetionDetails
    1. The SourceControlService starts the DataService
 1. The SinkOp starts the SourceController with ConnetionDetails given from the SourceOp
    1. The SourceController connects to the SourceControlService

Entry condition:

 - (Non-system) Two ports are already SSH forwarded between Source and Sink.

## Case: Init DataChannel
Participating actors: SinkOp

Flow of events:

 1. The SinkOp starts the DataClient
 1. DataClient connects to the DataService
 1. DataClient issues a registration request to the SourceController 
 1. The SourceController sends RegistrationRequest command to the SourceControlService
    1. The SourceControlService notifies the DataService to issue SynchronisationMessages
    1. DataService sends SynchronisationMessages to DataClient
    1. SourceControlService responds with a RegistrationRequestAcknowledgement
 1. The DataClient receives the SynchronisationMessages and notifies the SourceController of successful registration
 1. SourceController sends RegistrationSuccess command to the SourceControlService
    1. The SourceControlService notifies the DataService to stop sending SynchronisationMessages
    1. The SourceControlService sends RegistrationSuccessAcknowledgement

Entry condition:

 - SourceController is connected with SourceControlService

## Transfer Phase

```
'OUTDATED
@startuml
left to right direction

Source              <<Operator>>
Sink                <<Operator>>
"File Events" as Ev <<Operating System>>

rectangle "Transfer Phase" {
    :Commence Transfer: as (CT)
    :Transfer Report: as (TR)
    :Queue Report: as (QR)

    Source - (CT) : <<initiate>>
    Ev - (CT) : <<participate>>
    (CT) - Sink : <<participate>>

    (TR) - Sink : <<initiate>>
    Source - (TR) : <<participate>>

## Termination Phase

@startuml

rectangle "Termination Phase" {
    :Unregister from Service: as (US)
    :Service Termination: as (ST)

    Source - (US) : <<participate>>
    (US) - Sink : <<initiate>>

    (US) .> (ST) : <<include>>

    (ST) - Sink : <<participate>>
    Source - (ST) : <<initiate>>
